An Android app using geofencing, background services, and the barometer. 

This was created for my Cornell Tech class "Mobile and Ubiquitous Computing". The app accepts a user-inputted name, creates a geofence around the Cornell Tech campus, and pings a web server periodically whenever you enter, dwell, or leave the campus. It also exposes what floor you're on through detecting air pressures differences via the built-in barometer.
